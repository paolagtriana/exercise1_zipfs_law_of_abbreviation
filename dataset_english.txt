Yeah

I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
(Hey, hey, hey)
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)

Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away

So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Let go
I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I say so
I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (the echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

It's only me
What you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me
What are you gonna do?
It's only me
Let it go
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away

So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles

Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down

Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession (ooh, scary obsession, but)
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin' (nah, I can't)
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in (packed out)
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me and she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type and she's Latin (that's fit)
Got my own flow, and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand-new sheets for the bed, they satin (soft, real soft)
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then
My swag, they keep jackin' (keep on jackin')
I ain't doin' no verse, quit askin'
What's poppin'? (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
Brand new whip, just hopped in (ay, just hopped in)
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (ayy, men)
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in
My body got rid of them toxins (mmh, mmh)

That's all I plan to doI had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (might care, might care)
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say
"As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
It could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say
"As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?Roses, I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo

I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
But I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone
All I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little, by little, by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal, but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Would we be better off by now
If I'd let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you goMy last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drowned out pain by pouring up
Speeding fast on the run, never want to get caught up
Now you the one that I'm calling
Swore that I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talking
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya
Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feeling ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
I'll never give my all again
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Tear me up inside, and you break me downDo you love the rain? Does it make you dance
When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?
Do you think of me?
When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all
I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh)
Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
Did you get your middle name from your grandma?
When you think about your forever now, do you think of me?
When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all
I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours

Center of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
Now I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love
With the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doin' better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I know that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love

With the one that could break my heart?We used to chase that Chattanooga fray
Couple a kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple lamp
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now, what I was doing then
Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
You always used to talk about L.A
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Oh wait, you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as guitar town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know better
Haven't given' up, I'm just on your radio
Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Still chasing you, still chasing youJason Derulo, oh!

Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

Heart been broke so many times I
Don't know what to believe
Mama say it's my fault, it's my fault I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice
'Cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice
It's gettin' the best of me
While in the cell with Lil' Wakeem, after I slapped him I had told him
"I don't know how you get down with them clowns but I'm a soldier"
No one could understand, I had way too much aggression
That built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin' one day I'd find a piece of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin' not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days
Heart been broke so many times I
Don't know what to believe
Mama say it's my fault, it's my fault I wear my heart on my sleeve
Think it's best I put my heart on ice, heart on ice
'Cause I can't breathe
I'ma put my heart on ice, heart on ice
It's gettin' the best of me
